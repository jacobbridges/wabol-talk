After discussing a secret messaging system with a friend, the concept of the Wabol Talk program was conceived. It provides plausible deniability that a secret message is embedded in the encoded output when coupled with a web utility. Text given to the program goes through various layers of encoding and is obfuscated such that it is difficult to understand. Overall, it was a fun project to design, develop, and utilize.
